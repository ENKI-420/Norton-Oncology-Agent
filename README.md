Project Overview

The Norton-Oncology-Agent is specifically designed to bridge the gap between clinical research, genomic data analysis, and treatment recommendations. By integrating AI, genomics, and clinical trial data, we aim to provide a cutting-edge solution that assists healthcare professionals in selecting the most effective treatments based on a patient's specific mutation profile. The platform provides real-time, data-driven insights into mutation data, clinical trials, and therapeutic options to improve patient outcomes and advance oncology research.
üéØ Getting Started

To get started with Norton-Oncology-Agent, follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.
Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

    Node.js (v16+)
    Git (for version control)
    Python (v3.8+)
    PostgreSQL (or any relational database if required)

Step-by-Step Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ENKI-420/Norton-Oncology-Agent.git
cd Norton-Oncology-Agent

Install dependencies for the frontend (Next.js):

npm install

Install Python dependencies for the backend (if applicable):

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:

    Create a .env.local file in the root directory.
    Add the following environment variables:

EPIC_CLIENT_ID=your_epic_client_id
EPIC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_epic_client_secret
EPIC_REDIRECT_URI=your_epic_redirect_uri
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url (PostgreSQL or another DB)

Start the development server:

    Frontend (Next.js):

        npm run dev

        Ensure the backend API (e.g., Python server, database) is running.
